        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2> 
     <p>My name is Kimhor Bun. I am a 14 years old students who study at Liger Leadership Academy, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.I was born in Bangkok, Thailand, and grew up in a beautiful town of Kampong Chhnang province. Liger is a school that support with my education, health, food, accomodation, and my lifestyle. I felt that Liger is the first school that I ever enrolled that providing students with different resource of learning as well as having a good curriculum. When I studied at government school, my favorite subject was #Khmer History. Perhaps, When I received a full scholarship to study at Liger Leadership Academy, everything had changed me as a student studying in government. In Liger, I learned a project-based learning which is a new experience for me to experience these programs. Later on, I found myself loving to study about #Entrepreneurship, #Math, #Life-Science. These soft skills are crucial for me because in my future I want to become an #Entrepreneur and a #Science. When I have free time, I love to play frisbee, spend time with my friends, and listening to music. My favorite food is spasta and my least favorite is eating mushroom. 
            Overall, Liger is a path that guides me to see my brighter future.
